-----Metals and Tools-----
New Metals:
- Copper/Tin
- Bronze
- Steel (and potential derivatives, Damascus, folded, etc.)
- Mithril

Tiers of tools with new metals (worst to best (A rough approximation based on rarity, efficiency, and harvest level):
- Wood
- Stone
- Copper/Tin (same tier)
- Gold
- Bronze
- Iron
- Steel
- Mithril

Tool Harvest Levels (In one tier, the leftmost is the least efficient, and the rightmost is the most efficient)

0: Wood, Gold
1: Stone, Copper/Tin
2: Bronze, Iron
3: Steel, Mithril

How to get each new material:
Copper and Tin can be (somewhat) commonly found underground and easily smelted in a common furnace.
Bronze is made by alloying copper and tin. This requires a smelter, a new block, and a multiblock setup (the large
furnace) to be done with any kind of efficiency.
Steel is made by alloying iron and coal/charcoal in certain amounts, using the smelter, and the large furnace to
be done with any kind of efficiency.
Mithril is made by smelting rare mithril ore, again using the large furnace.

Changes to existing materials:
Gold and Iron now both require the smelter/large furnace to smelt.
Diamond is removed entirely, no more armor, weapons, or tools. I have other plans for gemstones.
Diamond ore will continue to generate normally.

Reasons as to why I am doing this (A.K.A. my opinions about game and setting design,
and my arcane protocols you must now follow):
Minecraft has no reason for you to create big workshops with lots of crafting stations. Almost anything can be done
on the go with the help of a furnace and crafting table which are very easy to acquire and transport. I think that
giant workshops (and maybe mod theme-appropriate automation, but I am getting ahead of myself) and really cool and
promote creative building and more linear progression, which is why I am making them essentially mandatory. This also
makes the world more interesting, showing the necessity of civilization and the sacrifices on makes while travelling
(Hello, Fellowship of the Ring). This also adds realism, and makes mining more effort than just bring a furnace and
wood into a cave. You have to develop your own metallurgical prowess, and work your way up. Craft your tools somewhere,
then ship them to where you want to go.

New Workstations
Smelter / Large Furnace:
The smelter is the new central crafting station. It will have 5 in-slots, where ores (or ingots, which smelt faster)
are inserted and smelted. You could use this to merely melt iron out of ore, or to alloy metals together, by placing
them in different slots. There is one output slot, which will yield your result (which may end up being slag if you
mix the wrong metals). There is also a fuel slot, with your choice of fuel altering the speed of smelting, with coal
the fastest, charcoal the next best, and wood the slowest.

Smelter UI Rough Sketch:

                         [ ]
              [ ]         |         [ ]
                 \        |        /
                  \       |       /
                   \      |      /
                    >    \|/    <
        [ ] - - - > [O U T P U T] < - - - [ ]

                          |
                        ( { \
                        ()\/||)  (Fire icon)
                         (\|\

                       [F U E L]

The smelter can be upgraded to a multiblock called the large furnace. It will share the same UI, but may be require for
some recipes and smelts faster. (Diagram is on test island).
Block Required:
Bricks (Any) (I will have to make a brick tag)
Smelter
Heat Proof Brick
Chimney
Bars (Any) (I will have to add other bar metals to make this) (I will have to add a bar tag)
In the center of the smelter there will be 1 block which will slowly build up ash, like snow, which will need to be
cleaned out.

Recipes for new Blocks
Legend:

b = Brick Item (Any, Regular, Nether, or Heat-Proof)
I = Any Ingot (Copper/Tin included)
C = Clay
B = Brick Block (Any, Regular, Nether, or Heat-Proof)


Smelter:
bIb
C C
bIb

Chimney:
 C
 B

Now that you have your ingots, you can craft. This uses a new multiblock crafting station, called the forge.
It consists of an anvil, next to the new forge station, next to a smithing table. The forge station functions similarly
to the smelter in the sense that it can be used alone or as part of a multiblock, with the multiblock being more
desirable. When multiblocked into the forge, the forge station gets a new slot in its GUI: the smithing tools spot.
There are five kinds of smithing tools, each of which will produce a slightly different weapon with differing stats:
- Elvish smithing tools, which make faster weapons, with their bows being better than other types. They cannot make
warhammers.
- Mannish smithing tools, which make slightly faster, slightly more damaging weapons, with their swords being better
than other types. They cannot make axes.
- Dwarven smithing tools, which make more damaging weapons, with their axes being better than other types. They cannot
make swords.
- Hobbitish smithing tools, which make more durable weapons, with their daggers being better than other types. They
cannot make spears.
- Orcish smithing tools, which make bleeding weapons (more on bleed soon), with their spears being better than other
types. They cannot make daggers.

New kinds of weapons:
- Daggers, which are much faster and lower-damage than swords, but have less range
- Spears, which have much more range than swords, but are really slow and don't deal all that much damage (to prevent
spears from being overpowered zone-out tools, which they too often become)
- Warhammers, which are slower than swords but deal way more knockback.

New status effects:
- Bleed, like a short-term poison.

Armour
Now, you must protect yourself with new kinds of armour. All new metals have craftable armour, along with chainmail
being craftable in all metal variants. Wearing heavier armour slows you down, inflicting a permanent mild slowness
depending on how much armor you are wearing. However, each piece of mithril armor gives you speed, which can offset
the slowness. Smithing tools do not make different kinds of armour.
